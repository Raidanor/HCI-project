## Getting Started
This project uses a React app template. After downloading our files:

1. Navigate to the frontend: cd frontend
2. Install the dependencies (this might take a while due to the size): npm install
3. Start the frontend: npm start

** Note: You need to start the backend as well to use our application! ** 

1. Open a new terminal. If you're using VS Code, you should see a little '+' icon that you can click.
2. Navigate to the backend: cd backend
3. Install the backend dependencies: npm install
4. Uninstall bcrypt: npm uninstall bcrypt
5. Reinstall bcrypt: npm install bcrypt
6. Start the backend: npm start
